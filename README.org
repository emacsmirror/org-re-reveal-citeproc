* Introduction
Project ~org-re-reveal-citeproc~ extends
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/][org-re-reveal]]
with support for a bibliography slide.
This file provides an example for the citation syntax introduced in
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] 9.5.  It can be exported
1. as [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] presentation with a
   bibliography slide,
2. to a plain HTML document, or
3. to PDF (via LaTeX).

*Beware!* Thanks to Org mode syntax, some headers (with Org commands
and comments) are not displayed (properly) on GitLab.

* Installation
   - Install [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] and ~org-re-reveal~
     (from MELPA or [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/][GitLab]])
   - Install recent (version 9.5) of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]
     and
     [[https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el][citeproc-el]]
     (~citeproc~ on MELPA)
   - Activate ~org-re-reveal-citeproc~
     - Place this directory into your load path or install it from
       [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]]
     - Load package manually (~M-x load-library~ followed by
       ~org-re-reveal-citeproc~) or place ~(require 'org-re-reveal-citeproc)~ into your
       "~/.emacs" and restart
   - Load an Org file and export it to HTML
     - Make sure that reveal.js is available in your current directory
       (e.g., as sub-directory or symbolic link)
     - Load "README.org" (coming with ~org-re-reveal-citeproc~)
     - Export to HTML: Press ~C-c C-e v v~ (write HTML file) or
       ~C-c C-e v b~ (write HTML file and open in browser)

* Outlook
   - Teaching and learning resources should be free and open
     - In support of
       [[https://www.sdg4education2030.org/the-goal][Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4)]]
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources (OER)]]
       - See [cite:@HWS+10] for technical and legal requirements of OER
   - My OER requirements (spelled out in German in [cite:@Lec19])
     - (Re-) Usable with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][FLOSS]]
     - Following paradigm of single sourcing (see [cite:@Roc01])
     - Platform independent, also offline use
     - Support proper license attribution beyond copy&paste
       - Tool support with [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
         (see [cite:@Lec19b;@Lec19c])
   - TODO: Emacs-reveal should contain ~org-re-reveal-citeproc~ soon

* Summary
   - Use ~cite~ links of Org mode 9.5
   - Insert bibliography on separate slide with ~print_bibliography~
     - See next slide
     - Important: You must use a ~CUSTOM_ID~ on that slide, whose
       value is that of customizable variable ~org-re-reveal-citeproc-bib~

* Bibliography

   :CUSTOM_ID: bibliography
